/* 
You're given an integer k representing anumber of workers and an array of positive integers representing durations of tasks that
must be completed by the workers. Specifically, each worker must complete two unique tasks and can only work on one task at a time.
the number of tasks will always be equal to 2k such that each worker always has exactly two tasks to complete. All tasks are
independent of one another and can be completed in any oreder. Workers will complete their assigned tasks in parallel, and the time
taken to complete all tasks will be equal to the time taken to complete the longest pair of tasks 

Write a function that returns the optimal assignment of tasks to each worker such taht the tasks are

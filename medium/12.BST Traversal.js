/* 
Write three functions that take in a Binary Search Tree(BST) and an empty array, traverse the BST, add its
nodes' values to the input array, and return that array. The three functions should traverse the BST using the in-order, pre-order, and post-order
tree-traversal techniques, respectively.
Each BST node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node. A node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property:
its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node
to its right; and its children nodes are either valid BST nodes themselves or None /null

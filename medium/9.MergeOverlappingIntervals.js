/* 
non-empty array of arbitrary intervals, merges any overlapping intervals, and returns the new intervals in no particular order.

interval is an array of two integers, with interval[0] as the start of the interval and interval[1] as the end

note that backtoback itnervals aren't considered to be overlapping. For example, [1,5,] and [6,7] aren't overlapping; [1,6] [6,7 are indeed overlapping]

    [1, 2],

    [9, 10]
  ]
  sample output: "intervals": [
    [1, 2],
